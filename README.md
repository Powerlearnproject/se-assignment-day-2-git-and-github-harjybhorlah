## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version control system is a system that allows you to control and track changes made to your file, it is essential when working on a collaborative project, version control lets you see and handle changes made to the project it also keeps you up to date on changes made. an example of such a system is gitbash
Github is popular because it serves as a cloud or host for you to share your files with other programmers, it serves as a destination where you can upload your project and collaborate with other programmers on developing the project
Version control helps maintain your project's integrity by allowing you to track every change made to your project, allowing developers to understand what has been changed, when, and by whom. it also gives you control access to decide to revert, merge, or delete different branches of the project 

## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?

## Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?
README file is important because it provides information about the repository, It serves as the primary source of information for anyone interacting with the repository
A well written Readme  should include information about the repository and also comments of recents changes done on the project by whom and when the changes has been carried out

## Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?
A public repository is accessible to everyone, Anyone can view and make changes to the repository while, A private repository is only accessible to you and any other individuals you have given access to, only such individuals can veiw and make changes to the repository
Advantages to each other are;
public repository exposes the project to a wide audience and number of indiviuals and allows for rapid developmennts and more hands on deck while private repository limits the projects to only a selected fee people
private repository is ideal for confidentiality and pose no risks of theft of private data  or information while public repository has no control or limit to what information should be concealed or revealed
